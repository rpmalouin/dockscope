**Visual, interactive Docker infrastructure debugger.**

A browser-based 3D dependency graph of your Docker services with live health, logs, metrics, and container actions. Mission control for your Docker Compose stacks.

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) must be installed and running. Kubernetes graph support is enabled automatically when DockScope can load a kubeconfig or in-cluster service account with read access to the Kubernetes API.

```bash
npx dockscope up
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g dockscope
dockscope up
```

### Docker (no Node.js needed)

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 4681:4681 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ghcr.io/manuelr-t/dockscope
```

> **Note:** The Docker image does not include Compose project management (up/down/destroy) since it cannot access host compose files. All other features work normally.

> **Security:** Mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` gives DockScope control over the host Docker daemon, including container actions and exec access. Only run it on trusted machines and networks.

Opens `http://localhost:4681`.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `-p, --port <port>` | `4681` | Server port (auto-increments if in use) |
| `-b, --bind <address>` | `127.0.0.1` | Listen address (`0.0.0.0` inside a container, or set `DOCKSCOPE_BIND`) |
| `--no-open` | — | Don't open browser |
| `dockscope scan` | — | Output graph as JSON (no UI) |

## Features

- **3D Force Graph** — Containers as interactive spheres, color-coded by health/status, with `depends_on` arrows and network links. Node size scales by importance (ports, connections, CPU, memory, I/O). Compose projects grouped with enclosure spheres.
- **Live Monitoring** — CPU, memory, network I/O polled every 3s with 5-minute sparkline history. Real-time Docker event stream.
- **Anomaly Detection** — CPU/memory spikes flagged using IQR-based outlier detection. Pulsing indicator on graph nodes, toast notification, and dismissable sidebar alert.
- **Crash Diagnostics** — When a container dies, auto-analyzes exit code, OOM status, and last log lines to surface the likely cause. Diagnostic card shown in the sidebar.
- **Dependency Impact View** — Select a node and toggle impact mode (`I` key) to highlight everything that would break if it goes down. Traverses `depends_on` upstream and dims unaffected nodes.
- **Container Actions** — Start, stop, restart, pause, unpause, kill, remove — directly from the sidebar with confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.
- **Log Streaming** — Live logs with ANSI color support, in-log search, and export to `.txt`.
- **Interactive Terminal** — Shell access (`/bin/sh`) via xterm.js embedded in the sidebar.
- **Compose Manager** — Up, down, stop, restart, destroy entire projects. Cached metadata survives `docker compose down`.
- **Container Inspection** — Env vars (secrets auto-masked), labels, mounts, processes, filesystem diff — all in sidebar tabs.
- **Search & Filters** — Real-time search by name/image, status filters (running/stopped/unhealthy), network color toggle.
- **Session Recording & Replay** — Record an incident (graph state, events, metrics over time) with the `REC` button in the status bar; stopping saves it as a JSON file. Replay it in place or load a recording file (upload button) on any DockScope instance, with a timeline scrubber, event markers, play/pause (`Space`), and 1–8× playback speed for postmortem analysis. During replay, live updates pause and container actions are disabled.
- **Snapshot Export** — Export the current graph view from the toolbar (bottom-left) as a PNG (exact render) or SVG (vector projection with labels, dependency arrows, and a status legend) for documentation and READMEs. Both respect active search/status filters.
- **Kubernetes Graph** — Pods, Services, Ingresses, and HPAs are rendered alongside Docker resources when Kubernetes API credentials are available. Services link to selected pods, Ingresses link to Services, HPAs show current vs desired replicas, and the HUD can filter Kubernetes resources by namespace.
